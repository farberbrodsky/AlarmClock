# AlarmClock
An alarm clock with two wireless mice - one for snooze, one for disable. It's hardcoded, currently not meant to be used by anybody else.

To run it, make sure to install speech-dispatcher (for the spd-say text to speech command), install simpleaudio using pip, and download an alarm.wav file (I use http://soundbible.com/2061-Loud-Alarm-Clock-Buzzer.html by Muk1984).
